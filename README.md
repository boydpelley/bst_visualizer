# Binary Search Tree Visualizer
This project is a simple visualzer to understand how binary search trees are implemented, from each node being added to (soon!) the nodes being searched to.
The main purpose of this project was to work on my SDL skills, as well as try to implement a data structure in a non-OOP language.

## Inputs
- i - insert node, enter in a positive value 3 digits and under to add a node to the tree
- r - random value, insert a random value from 0-100
- s - search, enter in a value to be searched in the tree (must exist otherwise does nothing)

## Future Additions
- Search is currently being implemented, where it will show the path of the node being searched for.
- Delete will be the next feature added, visualizing the process of node deletion.

## Considerations
- Self-balancing visualization when 'b' is pressed

## Intructions
1. Have SDL installed on your computer in your lib directory - you may need to change the CMake files to your devices requirements.
2. I implemented this in CLion, so it may be best to run in that IDE, but Visual Studio may prove to actually be a better option
3. Build project and hopefully everything should run okay!
